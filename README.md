#My Process

1st.   Wrote out a high level idea of the programme and user stories. This allowed me to think through what some of the methods and classes would need to include.
2nd.   Listed out what I was unsure of or less in doing. Decided to come back to these after doing some of the parts I could.
3rd    Created a relational diagram which allowed me to see which potential functions were related to each other.

4th    Mapped out the potential classes, their methods and which information needed to be passed between them. Labeled this in order of execution.
